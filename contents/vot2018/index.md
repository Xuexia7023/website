The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers and long-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

Following five highly successful VOT challenges, we are happy to announce the 6th Visual Object Tracking Challenge VOT2018 that will be held in conjunction with the [ECCV2018](https://eccv2018.org/).

Researchers from industry as well as academia are invited to participate. The challenge aims at single-object short-term trackers and long-term trackers that do not apply pre-learned models of object appearance (model-free).

Highlights
 * A new Long-term tracking subchallenge
