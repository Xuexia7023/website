# VOT2015 Challenge

## Call for participation and for papers

The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

Following two highly successful VOT challenges [VOT2013](/vot2013/) ([ICCV 2013](http://www.iccv2013.org/)) and [VOT2014](/vot2014/) ([ECCV2014](http://eccv2014.org/)), we are happy to announce the 3rd Visual Object Tracking Challenge VOT2015 to be held in conjunction with the ICCV2015. Researchers from industry as well as academia are invited to participate. Similarly to VOT2013 and VOT2014, the challenge aims at single-object short-term trackers that do not apply pre-learned models of object appearance (model-free). Trackers do not necessarily need to be capable of automatic re-initialization, as the objects are visible over the whole course of the sequences.

We are also announcing the first VOT thermal imagery tracking sub-challenge VOT-TIR2015. For convenience, the submission of the VOT2015 and the VOT-TIR2015 challenge is via a common submission system. The results of the VOT2015 and VOT-TIR2015 challenges will be presented at the ICCV2015 VOT workshop.

The VOT committee also solicits full-length papers describing:

* Original or improved trackers as well as papers giving new insights into existing trackers or class of trackers. See [participation page](participate.html) for details of the requirements for a tracking paper.
* Novel ways of using and extending the VOT framework for tracker performance analysis.


## Highlights

1. New fully annotated [dataset](dataset.html) compiled with the VOT dataset construction methodology
2. New toolkit for fast experiments execution with tutorials
3. New sub-challenge VOT-TIR
