## Participation

**Important:** Please, subscribe to our mailing list so that you receive recent news about the workshop and the challenge details.

The following compulsory steps are necessary to successfully participate:

1.	Read carefully the VOT2015 toolkit integration guidelines
2.	Download the latest version of the Matlab/Octave [evaluation kit](http://box.vicos.si/vot/evaluation_kit_2015.zip) or clone the Github repository. Participants are encouraged to help in the improvement of the kit!
3.	Follow the instructions of the guidelines ... 
- for installing the evaluation kit (sec. 7); the install process will automatically download the [dataset](http://box.vicos.si/vot/vot2015.zip)
- for integrating your tracker into the evaluation kit (sec. 8); beside last year's file protocol the new TraX protocol can be used 
- for performing the automated experiments 1 and 2 (sec. 7); if successful the evaluation kit will output a **single compressed results file**
4.	Upload the results file together with a brief description of the tracker, a summary as well as your personal information.

There are two different levels of participation in the VOT2015 challenge:

**Level 0 --** Tracking results included in the joint paper:
* Perform all the experiments of the VOT2015 challenge and submit them along with the description document. If a publication on the tracker exists, please provide a citation so that the paper can be correctly cited in the joint paper.

**Level 1 --** Becoming co-author of the joint paper and/or winning the challenge:

* Co-authors are required to perform all the experiments of the VOT2015 challenge and submit them along with the description document.
* Co-authors are required to submit the binaries or the source code of the tracker. Include all required libraries and ensure correct integration in the VOT toolkit. The VOT committee will use the submitted tracker only to verify the results and will delete the code/binaries after the challenge unless the authors agree to make the tracker publicly available on the VOT website.

How to participate in VOT-TIR2015 challenge:
Please visit the <???> page for details.

In order to submit a **full paper** to the workshop, participation according to level 0 or higher is required.

Participants of best performing trackers and **all authors** of accepted workshop papers give either poster or oral presentations at the workshop. The final decision will be made by the organizing committee.

The committee plans to invite the winners of the VOT2015 challenge and winners of the VOT-TIR2015 challenge as **invited speakers** to the workshop.
