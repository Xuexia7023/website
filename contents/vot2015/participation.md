Please, subscribe to our mailing list so that you receive recent news about the workshop and the challenge details.
</div>

The following compulsory steps are necessary to successfully participate:

1.	Download the latest version of the Matlab/Octave [evaluation kit](http://box.vicos.si/vot/evaluation_kit_2015.zip) or clone the Github repository. Participants are encouraged to help in the improvement of the kit!
2.	Read carefully the VOT toolkit integration guidelines
3.	Follow the instructions of the guidelines ... 
   - for installing the evaluation kit. The install process will automatically download the [dataset](http://box.vicos.si/vot/vot2015.zip)
   - for integrating your tracker into the evaluation kit.
   - for performing the automated experiment.
4.	Upload the results file together with a brief description of the tracker, a summary as well as your personal information.
   - If successful, the evaluation kit will output a **single compressed results file**
   - Upload the results along with the short [summary document]() using the [VOT2015 results submission page]().

## Participate in VOT2015 challenge

Follow the guidelines above to set up the workspace for VOT2015 challenge (select the `vot2015` experiment stack). This year only a single experiment will be performed, i.e., trackers initialized from the ground truth (this is equivalent to the VOT2014 baseline experiment).

There are two different levels of participation in the VOT2015 challenge:

 * **Level 0 --** Tracking results included in the joint paper:
   * Perform all the experiments of the VOT2015 challenge and submit them along with the description document. If a publication on the tracker exists, please provide a citation so that the paper can be correctly cited in the joint paper.


 * **Level 1 --** Becoming co-author of the VOT2015 joint paper and/or winning the VOT2015 challenge:
   * Co-authors are required to perform all the experiments of the VOT2015 challenge and submit them along with the [description document]().
   * Co-authors are required to submit the binaries or the source code of the tracker. Include all required libraries and ensure correct integration in the VOT toolkit. The VOT committee will use the submitted tracker only to verify the results and will delete the code/binaries after the challenge unless the authors agree to make the tracker publicly available on the VOT website.

## Participate in VOT-TIR2015 challenge

Follow the guidelines above to set up the workspace for VOT-TIR2015 challenge (select the `vottir2015` experiment stack). This year only a single experiment will be performed, i.e., trackers initialized from the ground truth (this is equivalent to the VOT2014 baseline experiment).

There are two different levels of participation in the VOT-TIR2015 challenge:

 * **Level 0 --** Tracking results included in the joint paper:
   * Perform all the experiments of the VOT2015 challenge and submit them along with the description document. If a publication on the tracker exists, please provide a citation so that the paper can be correctly cited in the joint paper.

 
 * **Level 1 --** Becoming co-author of the VOT-TIR2015 joint paper and/or winning the VOT-TIR2015 challenge:
   * Co-authors are required to perform all the experiments of the VOT-TIR2015 challenge and submit them along with the [description document]().
