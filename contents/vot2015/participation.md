## Prerequisites

A prerequisite for participating either VOT2015 or VOT-TIR2015 challenge is to have the most recent version of the VOT toolkit set up on your computer and that your tracker implementation is able to communicate with the toolkit. Follow [this tutorial](/howto/workspace.html) to download the toolkit and set up the environment and [this tutorial](/howto/integration.html) to integrate your tracker into the toolkit. Make sure that you select the correct experiment stack for the corresponding challenge. Then you have to run the experiments, pack the results and submit them. This is described in [this tutorial](/howto/perfeval.html).

## Participate in VOT2015 challenge

Follow the guidelines above to set up the workspace for VOT2015 challenge (select the `vot2015` experiment stack). This year only a single experiment will be performed, i.e., trackers initialized from the ground truth (this is equivalent to the VOT2014 baseline experiment).

There are two different levels of participation in the VOT2015 challenge:

 * **Level 0 --** Tracking results included in the joint paper:
   * Perform all the experiments of the VOT2015 challenge and submit them along with the description document. If a publication on the tracker exists, please provide a citation so that the paper can be correctly cited in the joint paper.


 * **Level 1 --** Becoming co-author of the VOT2015 joint paper and/or winning the VOT2015 challenge:
   * Co-authors are required to perform all the experiments of the VOT2015 challenge and submit them along with the [description document]().
   * Co-authors are required to submit the binaries or the source code of the tracker. Include all required libraries and ensure correct integration in the VOT toolkit. The VOT committee will use the submitted tracker only to verify the results and will delete the code/binaries after the challenge unless the authors agree to make the tracker publicly available on the VOT website.

## Participate in VOT-TIR2015 challenge

Follow the guidelines above to set up the workspace for VOT-TIR2015 challenge (select the `vottir2015` experiment stack). This year only a single experiment will be performed, i.e., trackers initialized from the ground truth (this is equivalent to the VOT2014 baseline experiment).

There are two different levels of participation in the VOT-TIR2015 challenge:

 * **Level 0 --** Tracking results included in the joint paper:
   * Perform all the experiments of the VOT2015 challenge and submit them along with the description document. If a publication on the tracker exists, please provide a citation so that the paper can be correctly cited in the joint paper.

 
 * **Level 1 --** Becoming co-author of the VOT-TIR2015 joint paper and/or winning the VOT-TIR2015 challenge:
