# VOT2017 Challenge

<img class="logo float-right frame" src="../img/vot2017_logo_website_large.png" alt="VOT2017" />

## Call for participation and for papers
The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

Following four highly successful VOT challenges, we are happy to announce the 5th Visual Object Tracking Challenge VOT2017 that will be held in conjunction with the [ICCV2017](http://iccv2017.thecvf.com/).

Researchers from industry as well as academia are invited to participate. The challenge aims at **single-object short-term trackers** that do not apply pre-learned models of object appearance (**model-free**). Trackers do not necessarily need to be capable of automatic re-initialization, as the objects are visible over the whole course of the sequences.

The results of the VOT2017 challenge will be presented at the ICCV2017 VOT workshop.

The VOT committee also solicits full-length papers describing:

 * Original or improved trackers as well as papers giving new insights into existing trackers or class of trackers. See [participation page](/vot2017/participation.html) for details of the requirements for a tracking paper.
 * Novel ways of using and extending the VOT framework for tracker performance analysis.

Visit the [participation page](/vot2017/participation.html) for more information on how to participate.
