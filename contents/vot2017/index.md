# VOT2017 Challenge

<img class="logo float-right frame" src="../img/vot2017_logo_website_large.png" alt="VOT2017" />

The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

Following four highly successful VOT challenges, we are happy to announce the 5th Visual Object Tracking Challenge VOT2017 that will be held in conjunction with the [ICCV2017](http://iccv2017.thecvf.com/).

Researchers from industry as well as academia are invited to participate. The challenge aims at **single-object short-term trackers** that do not apply pre-learned models of object appearance (**model-free**). Trackers do not necessarily need to be capable of automatic re-initialization, as the objects are visible over the whole course of the sequences.

### Highlights

 * Updated dataset
 * Realtime experiment
 * Full transition to TraX protocol
 * Winner will be determined on a sequestered dataset

### Participate by

 * Run your tracker on VOT2017 challenge and submit the results. The joint results of the VOT2017 challenge will be presented at the VOT2017 workshop.
 * Run your tracker on VOT-TIR2017 challenge (which is the VOT-TIR2016 reopened) and submit the results.
 * Submit (and present) a research paper on visual tracking at the VOT2017 workshop.
