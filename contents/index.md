  </div>
</div>

The VOT challenges provide the visual tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

The goal of the challenges is to build up a repository of considerable benchmarks and to organize workshops or similar events in order to push forward research in visual tracking.

    <h3 class="panel-title"> June 9th, 2016 - Important notice: VOT2016 toolkit update</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
  
    We have noticed that the latest VOT2016 toolkit changes (12.5.2016 release) did not properly 
    compute the rotated bounding box overlaps cropped to image boundary. This has now been fixed 
    and we ask all participants to update their toolkits. We hope this does not introduce too much 
    additional work to the VOT2016 participants. If you have any questions or need help with 
    integration, please do not hesitate to contact the technical team or the VOT support forum.
    <br><br>

    IMPORTANT: Please update your VOT2016 toolkit version and re-run the experiments.
    <br><br>

    To properly update, you will need to delete the current toolkit from you computer and download 
    it again. This will also ensure that fresh pre-compiled binaries are downloaded. You do not 
    have to delete the workspace directory, but you will have to remove the obsolete results in the 
    results subdirectory of the workspace and re-run the tracker.

    There has been some delay in the final steps of VOT2016 dataset preparation. The VOT2016 dataset release date has been moved to Wednesday 25.05. But the toolkit will be ready on Monday 16th. So you can download it and test your tracker integration to make sure everything works. The dataset will be the same as in VOT2015, but the ground truth annotation will change.
    <br><br>
    The VOT-TIR2016 challenge IS OPEN and contains new sequences:

  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    We are happy to announce the 4th VOT Workshop, that will take place in conjunction with ECCV 2016.
    <br>
    The event follows the three highly sucessful workshops VOT2013 (ICCV2013), VOT2014 (ECCV2014), and VOT2015 (ICCV2015).
    We are also announcing the second VOT thermal imagery tracking sub-challenge VOT-TIR2016. 
    <br><br>
    Authors of new and old trackers are kindly invited to participate either by running their trackers on the 2016 datasets, or by contributing with a paper.
    <br><br>
    Highlights:
    <br>
    - Participate at VOT2016/VOT-TIR2016 and become a coauthor of the results paper. 
    <br>
    - Participate by submitting a full-length paper
    <br>
    - Papers revised rejected at [ECCV 2016](http://www.eccv2016.org/) will be considered as well (separate deadline!).

    Please visit the [VOT2016 homepage](http://votchallenge.net/vot2016/) for details.

  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Dear supporters of VOT,

    <br><br>
    The recent visual object tracking challenge VOT2015 introduced the first thermal and infrared tracking 
    sub-challenge. The attendance was great and we were able to test a significant number of trackers on this 
    visual modality. To increase the complexity and size of the datasets used in the forthcoming challenges, we 
    are issuing a call for sequence contribution. The call will stay open and people are welcome to contribute. 
    We appreciate your support; a successful challenge requires a challenging dataset and we depend on the 
    communities contributions!

    <h3 class="panel-title">VOT Challenge 2016</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Dear supporters of VOT,

    <br><br>
    We have started with preparations for VOT2016 which is planned to be held in conjunction with one of upcoming 
    major computer vision conferences, should the proposal for the workshop be accepted. The workshop is planned to 
    be again composed of results presentations, invited talks, winner presentations and presentations of contributed 
    papers.
    <br><br>
    A standard review process will be conducted for the papers submitted to VOT as contributed papers. We will also 
    try to enable submissions of high-quality papers rejected at ECCV with a topic relevant to VOT. Since the ECCV 
    author notification deadline is quite late, we will try to arrange a late submission deadline for these papers. 
    The papers should preferably include evaluation on the VOT2015 dataset.
    <br><br>
    The computer vision community has witnessed a great success of learning algorithms that apply extremely large 
    number of parameters and typically require large datasets to learn the parameters and even larger datasets to 
    validate whether they have overfitted to the data. We have been discussing the role of learning in VOT and a 
    danger of overfitting to the typical tracking datasets. In response we will impose and additional constraint on 
    the trackers that will be considered as winners of VOT2016.
    <br><br>
    Constraint1: Learning from the tracking datasets is not allowed (OTB, VOT, ALOV, NUSPRO). The use of class labels 
    specific to VOT is not allowed (i.e., identifying a target class in each sequence and applying pretrained 
    class-specific trackers is not allowed).
    <br><br>
    Constraint2: The winning tracker has to provide CPU-only implementation for results validation (in addition to a 
    potential GPU implementation). 
    <br><br>
    To allow timely verification of the results on the VOT side, we will require the authors of trackers considered for 
    winning position to help us run their tracker and reproduce part of the results. We will thus apply a constraint 
    on the required hardware for partial reproduction of the results.
    <br><br>
    Note that Constraints 1 and 2 apply only to the trackers that are considered for winners of VOT2016. We will also 
    accept submissions that do not account for the two constraints, but these will not be considered for the winning 
    position.

    We are happy to announce that the VOT (2013-2014) methodology paper has been accepted to Transactions on Pattern 
    Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). The paper can be accessed from the [VOT publications page 
    link](http://www.votchallenge.net/publications.html). For future reference, if you use any of the VOT datasets 
    in your evaluation, please cite this paper as  methodology reference as well as the relevant VOT workshop paper
