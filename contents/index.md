##### Call for participation and for papers

Research on visual tracking remains limited due to the lack of
standardised evaluation protocols and online reference repositories
showing results on community accepted reference videos. VOT2013 invites
researchers to participate in a first challenge focusing on single
object visual tracking.

The aim of the accompanying VOT2013 workshop, which will be held in
conjunction with ICCV2013, is to provide a common platform for
comparison, analysis and discussion of existing as well as new single
object trackers. We provide an [evaluation kit](evaluation_kit.html)
that includes videos with annotated ground truth as well as evaluation
software to automate the experiments and calculate the performance
measures.

##### How to participate

The participants have to download the [VOT2013 evaluation
kit](evaluation_kit.html), and run the experiments on their tracker. The
results of the [experiments](evaluation_kit.html#A_short_description)
have to be submitted, along with a [summarising
description](participation.html) of the tracker, through the [VOT2013
submission page](submission.html). The results of Level 1 and Level 2
participants ([see "Levels of
participation"](participation.html#Levels_of_participation)),
accompanied with the [tracker description](participation.html), will
become part of a co-authored paper which will be published in the ICCV
VOT2013 workshop proceedings.

Each participant that submits the results is a co-author by default!

In addition, the authors may submit an original workshop paper, that
will go through a peer-review process. Accepted original papers will be
published in the ICCV workshop proceedings and will be presented at the
workshop.
