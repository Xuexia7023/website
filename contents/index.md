The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

The goal of the challenges is to build up a repository of considerable benchmarks and to organize workshops or similar events in order to push forward research in visual tracking.

The first challenge introduced a new evaluation kit (software plus 16 well-known short videos) and compared 27 single-target trackers submitted by 51 participants. The results were published in a joint paper presented at an ICCV2013 workshop which was attended by over 70 researchers.
