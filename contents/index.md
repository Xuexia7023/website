#About

The VOT challenges provide the visual tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

The goal of the challenges is to build up a repository of considerable benchmarks and to organize workshops or similar events in order to push forward research in visual tracking.

# Highlights

## VOT2015 challenge

We are preparing a new challenge this year. Official announcement with the details is expected in June. Enroll on the [VOT mailing list](https://service.ait.ac.at/mailman/listinfo/votchallenge) for latest news.

## Comments on the VOT toolkit

Due to increasing interest in the VOT analysis, which also results in numerous questions regarding the correct usage of the toolkit, the VOT committee has released an official statement regarding using the VOT evaluation toolkit analysis for scientific papers. The statement is available [<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></i>here](/res/toolkit.pdf).

## New VOT papers 

We would like to bring your attention to a paper that we have been working on which summarizes the VOT methodology and analysis developed in years (2013-2014). The initial version of the paper was submitted to a journal in early 2014, but it took over half of year for the first round of review feedback and it will likely take some time until the final publication.

The VOT committee therefore decided that we should share the results of the paper with the wider VOT community. The paper is available on arXiv under ID [<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></i>arXiv:1503.01313](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01313).

The paper above cites another paper, which was the basis for the basic performance measure selection in VOT2013. This paper was since extended and submitted to a journal. An arXiv version is available under ID [<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></i>arXiv:1502.05803](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05803).
