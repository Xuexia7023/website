## Prerequisites

A prerequisite for participating either VOT2016 challenge or VOT-TIR2016 challenge is to have the most recent version of the VOT toolkit set up on your computer and that your tracker implementation is able to communicate with the toolkit. Follow [this tutorial](/howto/workspace.html) to download the toolkit and set up the environment and [this tutorial](/howto/integration.html) to integrate your tracker into the toolkit. Make sure that you select the correct experiment stack for the corresponding challenge. Then you have to run the experiments, pack the results and submit them. This is described in [this tutorial](/howto/perfeval.html).

## Participate in VOT2016 challenge or in VOT-TIR2016 challenge

We will also consider papers rejected at the ECCV2016, provided that the authors include the original reviews and the response with a list of potential changes.


Two constraints are placed on trackers that will be considered for winners:

Constraint1: Learning from the tracking datasets is not allowed (OTB, VOT, ALOV, NUSPRO). The use of class labels specific to VOT is not allowed (i.e., identifying a target class in each sequence and applying pretrained class-specific trackers is not allowed).  
  
Constraint2: The winning tracker has to provide CPU-only implementation for results validation (in addition to a potential GPU implementation). The authors of the tracker are required to cooperate with VOT to help run the tracker and reproduce the results.

Note that Constraints 1 and 2 apply only to the trackers that are considered for winners of VOT2016. We will also accept submissions that do not account for the two constraints, but these will not be considered for the winning position.
