# VOT2016 Benchmark

## Call for participation and for papers
The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

Following three highly successful VOT challenges [VOT2013](/vot2013/index.html) (ICCV2013), [VOT2014](/vot2014/index.html) (ECCV2014), and [VOT2015](/vot2015/index.html) (ICCV2015), we are happy to announce the 4th Visual Object Tracking Challenge VOT2016 to be held in conjunction with the [ECCV2016](http://www.eccv2016.org/). 

Researchers from industry as well as academia are invited to participate. The challenge aims at **single-object short-term trackers** that do not apply pre-learned models of object appearance (**model-free**). Trackers do not necessarily need to be capable of automatic re-initialization, as the objects are visible over the whole course of the sequences.

We are also announcing the second VOT thermal imagery tracking sub-challenge VOT-TIR2016. The details of the VOT2016 and VOT-TIR2016 sub-challenge will be available soon.

The results of the VOT2016 and VOT-TIR2016 challenges will be presented at the ECCV2016 VOT workshop.

The VOT committee also solicits full-length papers describing:

 * Original or improved trackers as well as papers giving new insights into existing trackers or class of trackers. See [participation page](/vot2016/participation.html) for details of the requirements for a tracking paper.
 * Novel ways of using and extending the VOT framework for tracker performance analysis.
