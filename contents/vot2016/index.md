# VOT2016 Challenge

<img class="logo float-right frame" src="../img/vot2016_logo_website_large.png" alt="VOT2016" />

## Call for participation and for papers
We are happy to announce the 4th VOT Workshop, that will take place in conjunction with ECCV 2016.
The event follows the three highly sucessful workshops VOT2013 (ICCV2013), VOT2014 (ECCV2014), and VOT2015 (ICCV2015).

Researchers from industry as well as academia are invited to participate. The challenge aims at **single-object short-term trackers** that do not apply pre-learned models of object appearance (**model-free**). Trackers do not necessarily need to be capable of automatic re-initialization, as the objects are visible over the whole course of the sequences.

We are also announcing the second VOT thermal imagery tracking sub-challenge VOT-TIR2016. The details of the VOT2016 and VOT-TIR2016 sub-challenge will be available soon.

The results of the VOT2016 and VOT-TIR2016 challenges will be presented at the ECCV2016 VOT workshop.

The VOT committee also solicits full-length papers describing:

 * Original or improved trackers as well as papers giving new insights into existing trackers or class of trackers. See [participation page](/vot2016/participation.html) for details of the requirements for a tracking paper.
 * Novel ways of using and extending the VOT framework for tracker performance analysis.
 * We will consider papers rejected at ECCV 2016, accompanied with a cover letter describing the difference between ECCV and VOT submissions.
