## Benchmarks

Official results of past challenges are still available as a benchmark to researchers. We heartly invite everybody to compare their methods with those results.

The first challenge introduced a new evaluation kit (software plus 16 well-known short videos) and compared 27 single-target trackers submitted by 51 participants. The results were published in a joint paper presented at an ICCV2013 workshop which was attended by over 70 researchers.
