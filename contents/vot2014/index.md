##### Call for participation and for papers

The increasing number of publications on tracking has made it impossible to follow all the developments. The [VOT2013](/vot2013/) challenge therefore introduced a new evaluation kit (software plus 16 well-known short videos) and compared and ranked in a joint workshop paper 27 single-target model-free trackers submitted by 51 participants. The results were presented with great success to more than 70 researchers attending the workshop at ICCV2013.

The goal of this second workshop is to prolong the success of VOT2013 and to invite researchers from academia and industry to participate in a second challenge. This challenge aims at <b>single-object short-term trackers</b> that do not apply pre-learned models of object's appearance (<b>model-free</b>) and process only short videos. The location of the object is given at the beginning.

The challenge provides further an <b>improved version</b> of the cross-platform evaluation software, which will much faster execute the experiments thanks to a powerful new communication protocol between kit and tracker. The dataset is enriched with new videos (in total 25 sequences) and labelled with <b>rotating</b> bounding boxes rather than bounding boxes solely axis aligned.
