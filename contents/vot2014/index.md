##### Call for participation and for papers

The increasing number of publications on tracking has made it impossible to follow all the developments. The [VOT2013](/vot2013/) challenge therefore introduced a new evaluation kit (software, 16 well-known short videos) and compared and ranked in a joint workshop paper 27 single-target model-free trackers submitted by 51 participants. The results were presented with great success to more than 70 researchers attending the workshop at [ICCV2013](http://www.iccv2013.org).

VOT2014 will try to prolong this success by providing an improved version of the cross-platform [evaluation software](evaluation_kit.html), which will much faster execute the experiments. The labelled dataset will be enriched by new videos. Participants with eligible trackers will automatically become co-authors of the results paper, which will be published in the workshop proceedings. The participants however have this year to achieve a reasonable baseline performance. Participants have additionally the opportunity to publish a peer-reviewed technically solid paper where novelty is of less concern.

Participants of best performing trackers and authors of accepted workshop papers will be encouraged to give presentations at the workshop. The VOT2014 committee will invite the winner of the challenge for an oral presentation.
