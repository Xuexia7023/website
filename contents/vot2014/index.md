##### Call for participation and for papers

Research on visual tracking remains limited due to the lack of
standardised evaluation protocols and online reference repositories
showing results on community accepted reference videos. Following the
success of [VOT2013](/vot2013/), the VOT2014 organizers invite researchers to 
participate in the second VOT challenge focusing on single
object visual tracking.

The aim of the accompanying VOT2014 workshop, which will be held in
conjunction with ECCV2014, is to provide a common platform for
comparison, analysis and discussion of existing as well as new single
object trackers. We provide an [evaluation kit](evaluation_kit.html)
that includes videos with annotated ground truth as well as evaluation
software to automate the experiments and calculate the performance
measures.

##### How to participate

More information about participation coming soon.
