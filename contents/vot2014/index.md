##### Call for participation and for papers

The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a new standard way of comparing short-term trackers and provide a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

The first challenge  - ([VOT2013](/vot2013/)) - introduced a new evaluation kit (software plus 16 well-known short videos) and compared 27 single-target model-free trackers submitted by 51 participants. The results were published in a joint paper presented at a ICCV2013 workshop, which was attended by over 70 researchers.

This year, the VOT committee is organizing the VOT2014 challenge in conjunction with the ECCV2014 and invites researchers from academia and industry to participate. Similarly to VOT2013, the challenge aims at <b>single-object short-term trackers</b> that do not apply pre-learned models of object's appearance (<b>model-free</b>) and process only short videos. The location of the object is given at the beginning.

<u>VOT2014 highlights:</u>
- An improved version of the cross-platform evaluation kit, which will much faster execute the experiments thanks to a powerful new communication protocol between kit and tracker
- The dataset is enriched with new videos (in total 25 sequences) and labelled with rotating bounding boxes rather than bounding boxes solely axis aligned
- The dataset is per-frame labelled with attributes
- All the participants who submit results that exceed a reasonable low threshold on performance automatically become co-authors of the joint paper that will be published in the workshop proceedings 
- Participants may submit their own workshop paper
- A prize will be awarded to the best-performing tracking team
