<b>Important:</b> Please, subscribe to our [mailing list](https://service.ait.ac.at/mailman/listinfo/votchallenge) so that you receive recent news about the workshop and the challenge details.

The following compulsory steps are necessary to successfully participate:

1. Read carefully the challenge [guidelines](/vot2014/download/vot2014-guidelines.pdf)
2. [Download](https://github.com/vicoslab/vot-toolkit/archive/master.zip) the latest version of the Matlab/Octave evaluation kit or [clone](https://github.com/vicoslab/vot-toolkit) the Github repository. Participants are encouraged to help in the improvement of the kit!
3. Follow the instructions of the guidelines ...
<br>- for installing the evaluation kit (sec. 7);  the install process will automatically download the dataset
<br>- for integrating your tracker into the evaluation kit (sec. 8); beside last year's file protocol the new TraX protocol can be used
<br>- for performing the automated experiments 1 and 2 (sec. 7); if successful the evaluation kit will output a <b>single compressed results file</b>
4. [Upload](/vot2014/submission.html) the results file together with a brief description of the tracker, a summary as well as your personal information.

There are two different levels of participation in the VOT2014 challenge:

**Level 0** -- Tracking results included in the joint paper:
+ Perform all the experiments of the VOT2014 challenge and submit them along with the
description document.
If a publication on the tracker exists, please provide a citation
so that the paper can be correctly cited in the joint paper.

**Level 1** -- Becoming co-author of the joint paper and/or winning the challenge:

+ Co-authors are required to perform all the experimen of the VOT2014 challenge and submit them along with the description document.
+ Co-authors are required to submit the binaries or the source code of the tracker.
Make sure to include all required libraries and to ensure a correct integration in
the VOT toolkit. The VOT committee will use the submitted tracker only to verify the results and
will delete the code/binaries after the challenge unless the authors agree to make the tracker publicly available on the VOT website.

In order to [submit](/vot2014/submission.html) a **full paper** to the workshop, participation according to level 0 or higher is required.

Participants of best performing trackers and <b>all authors</b> of accepted workshop papers give either poster or oral presentations at the workshop. The final decision will be made by the organizing committee.

The committee plans to invite the winner of the challenge as <b>invited speaker</b> to the workshop. For the first time this year, the winner will receive an <b>award</b> sponsored by University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science.
