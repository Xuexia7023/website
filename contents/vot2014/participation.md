<b>Important:</b> Please, subscribe to our [mailing list](https://service.ait.ac.at/mailman/listinfo/votchallenge) so that you receive the recent news about the workshop and the challenge details.

The following mandatory steps guide the participant through the challenge:

1. Read carefully the VOT2014 [guidelines](/vot2014/vot2014-guidelines.pdf)
2. [Download](https://github.com/vicoslab/vot-toolkit/archive/master.zip) the latest version of the Matlab/Octave evaluation kit or [clone](https://github.com/vicoslab/vot-toolkit) the repository.
3. Follow the instructions of the [guidelines](/vot2014/vot2014-guidelines.pdf) ...
<br>- for installing the evaluation kit (section 7, guidelines);  the install process will automatically download the dataset
<br>- for integrating your tracker into the evaluation kit (section 8, guidelines); beside last year's file protocol the new TraX protocol can be used
<br>- for performing the automated experiments 1 and 2 (section 7, guidelines); if successful the evaluation kit will output a single compressed results file
4. Go to the workshop's submission [page](/vot2014/submission) and upload the results file together with a short summary of the tracker as well as your personal information

Participants with a proper submission and uncorrupted original/untouched results files <b>are immediately considered as co-authors</b> of the results paper, which will be published in the workshop proceedings. To effectively become a co-author the participants however have this year to achieve the baseline performance of a cross correlation [tracker]().

Additional steps the participant may consider:

- Go to the workshop's submission [page](/vot2014/submission) and submit your own <b>technically solid workshop paper</b> where novelty is of less concern. The paper will be peer-reviewed and on acceptance it will be published in the workshop proceedings
- During the submission process of the results file you may submit the binaries and/or source code of your tracker for verification by the Technical committee

Participants of best performing trackers and <b>all</b> authors of accepted workshop papers give either poster or oral presentations at the workshop. The final decision will be made by the organizing committee. The committee will invite the winner of the challenge as <b>invited speaker</b> to the workshop. The winner will receive the <b>VOT2014 award</b> sponsored by University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science.
