### Upload the results file
Participants with a proper [submission](submission_page.html) and uncorrupted original/untouched results file <b>are immediately considered as co-authors</b> of the joint workshop paper, which will be published in the workshop proceedings.

<b>Important:</b> To effectively become a co-author, the participants have this year to achieve the baseline performance of a cross correlation tracker.

<b>Notice: </b>Participants will receive an immediate acknowledgment after successful submission. Please, save this acknowledgment for your own records. 


### Submit your own workshop paper
The manuscripts should be [submitted](https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/VOT2014/) as PDF files and should be no more than 12 pages in the ECCV paper format. Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Acceptance will be based on relevance to the workshop and technical solidity, novelty is of less concern. We even encourage the submission of existing work. On acceptance the paper will be published in the workshop proceedings.

<b>Important:</b> The upload of the results file is compulsory for acceptance of your own workshop paper.
