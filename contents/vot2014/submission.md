### Upload the results file
Participants with a proper [submission](submission_page.html) and uncorrupted original/untouched results file <b>are immediately considered as co-authors</b> of the joint workshop paper, which will be published in the workshop proceedings.

During submission, the participants have to provide personal information and a formless PDF describing the tracker. You may adapt the [template](/vot2014/download/template_results.zip) of VOT2013 for the document.

<b>Important:</b> To effectively become a co-author, the participants have this year to achieve the baseline performance of a normalized cross-correlation tracker (NCC). The NCC tracker is provided in the evaluation kit as a demo tracker.

<b>Notice: </b>Participants will receive an immediate acknowledgment after successful submission.

### Submit your own workshop paper
Manuscripts in [ECCV](http://eccv2014.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/eccv2014kit.zip) paper format must be [submitted](https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/vot2014) as PDF files not exceeding 12 pages. Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers (double-blind). Acceptance will be based on relevance to the workshop and technical solidity, novelty is of less concern. We even encourage the submission of existing work. On acceptance the paper will be published in the workshop proceedings.

<b>Important:</b> The upload of the results file is compulsory for acceptance of your own workshop paper. Submissions will be rejected without review if they exceed the maximum length or violate the double-blind policy.
